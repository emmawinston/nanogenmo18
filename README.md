Boring Tales From Tiny Places
--------------------------------

This is really an attempt to teach myself:

1) a bit more Javascript than the pitiful amount I already know
2) How the RiTa text library works. 

The basic structure:

* I generate a Tiny Scenario(TM) using Tracery, as per my various Twitter bots. 
* I identify the emoji characters in them. 
* I set up some kind of templated exposition for the 'story'.
* I attribute some emotions and actions to the characters. 
* I have the characters ramble at each other with Markov chains, using a genre-appropriate text source.
* Punchline. 
* Fin. 

I make some apologies for the extremely poor quality of my code, but not too many. Learning!
